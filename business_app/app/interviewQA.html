<p>Tip: This question is super broad for a reason. It can either make you or break you, so make sure to prepare a thoughtful response. Remember, this should feel more like a conversation than a question-answer time. Don’t forget to ask the interviewer questions, too.
		Do: Focus on your career. How did you get here? Where do you want to go? Answer this question by highlighting why you are the best candidate. Spend about 3 minutes on this response. 
		Don’t: Tell your life story. Don’t ramble on. Don’t talk about your pets.
